# Spotify-Database-Project

Here is our project. We used the R app file. We ended up not using the streamlit and python app file due to various issues
cleaned_spotify_ascii_only.csv is the raw data file
Database_Schema = picture of database schema
App.R is the R file for web app creation through Shiny
